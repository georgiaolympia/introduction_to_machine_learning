# Course Description

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to act without being explicitly programmed. It is the science behind countless technological advancements, like self-driving cars, speech recognition, effective web search and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Moreover it gives us the tools to approach existing problems in a new way by learning from data and experience.

This course provides a practical introduction to machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition. Based on a real life problem you will learn how methods of supervised and unsupervised machine learning work, gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly you will also learn how to leverage machine learning techniques for problems and use cases you might encounter in your own work or field of study.
